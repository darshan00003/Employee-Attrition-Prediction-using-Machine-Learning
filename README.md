# Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze employee data and predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization.
Machine learning techniques were applied to understand attrition patterns and make predictions.

## Dataset Source
IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset from Kaggle.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Machine Learning Model
Logistic Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the employee_attrition.csv file
3. Run all cells in order

## Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 89%.
EDA showed that attrition is influenced by department, job satisfaction, and income levels.
